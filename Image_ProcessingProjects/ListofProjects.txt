Reading Static Images using Arduino Mega and Display it in I2C

For Face Reader eye close open detection, finger count we need tesseract and tesseract-ocr. 
For Face recognition need face recognition library.
For face recog need dlib to be builded for the building we need cmake and visual studio++ for building   or we can use prebuild dlib.
Thanks! Since you're using:
✅ Python 3.12.3
✅ 64-bit Windows
Unfortunately, there is no precompiled dlib wheel available for Python 3.12 yet — which is why you're running into constant build errors. dlib and face_recognition do not currently support Python 3.12 officially.
